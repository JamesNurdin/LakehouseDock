"""

A query's prompt has three parts, with a single unified construct-selection step:

  1. FAMILY     (PROMPT_VARIANTS) -- what KIND of query. Base task text, table-count
                                     band.
  2. CONSTRUCTS (CONSTRUCTS)      -- ONE operator-grounded catalog (clause constructs
                                     + operator levers). The feedback policy draws a
                                     small, coverage-weighted subset per query 
                                     (feedback.choose_constructs), appended as
                                     "Additionally: - ...". FINISHERS (order_by,
                                     limit) are cheap and rolled independently.
  3. PLAN-SHAPE (PLAN_SHAPES)     -- a pure join TOPOLOGY hint for join_all families.

Important SQL rules:
- Use Trino SQL syntax.
- Use only the selected tables.
- Use only columns that appear in the DDL context.
- Use only the listed join rules.
- Do not invent tables, columns, or join keys.
- Avoid SELECT *.
- Unless the task explicitly asks for a simple query, produce a non-trivial analytical query (joins, filtering, grouping, aggregation and/or ordering) and vary the query shape from previous queries.
- Columns ending in *_date_sk are integer surrogate keys, not DATE values.
- Only filter on DATE literals via a DATE-typed column shown in the DDL context.
- Do not use SELECT aliases in GROUP BY, WHERE, or HAVING.
- If a derived expression is selected and also grouped, repeat the full expression in GROUP BY or use a CTE/subquery.
- After defining a CTE or subquery alias, only reference columns explicitly projected by that CTE/subquery.
- Preserve original column names carefully when moving columns through CTEs.
- After joining tables, CTEs, or subqueries, qualify column names when the same column name may exist on both sides of the join.
- Do not reference unqualified columns if they are available from multiple joined sources.
